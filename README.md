# Real Work

Real Work is a web application that helps you track your work/study sessions and record important details such as activity, intensity, time, and what we like to call "Real Work". "Real Work" is the product of your intensity and time. It quantifies how long it would have taken you to completed the activity if you performed at your peak. Finally, this application allows you to keep a log of your work/study sessions and provides summary statistics to help you analyze your study habits.
